## PIE
`Position Independent Executables`
- `PIE` is intended for executables
- `PIE`  is an output of the hardened package build process
- `PIE` binaries and all of its dependencies are loaded into random locations within virtual memory each time the application is executed.

---

## NX ( No eXecute )
- also known as `DEP (data execution prevention)` 
- marks certain areas of the program as non executable, eliminating the chance of getting shellcode execution
- with NX techniques like code reuse (ROP) still work against it

+ Bypassing NX
	- Code Reuse Techniques ( ROP, JOP )
	- ret2libc

---

## ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization )
- Randomizes places in memory where the program, shared libraries, the stack, and the heap are
- Heap, or libc can't be re-used between program launches
- Things like uncontrolled format strings and other vulnerabilities can prove useful when bypassing ASLR, because you can get a memory leak when dealing with format strings
	
+ Bypassing ASLR
	- Bruteforce required memory address
	- memory leaks
	- uncontrolled format strings (to get memory leaks)

--- 

## Stack Canaries
- Stack Canaries are a secret value placed on the stack which changes every time the program is started
- Prior to a function return, the stack canary is checked and if it appears to be modified, the program exits immediately
- Basically stack canaries are put in place in memory each time the program starts, if its modified it makes the program exit

+ Bypassing Stack Canaries
	- Brute-forcing the stack canary
	- memory leaks

- bypassing control flow integrity or control-flow enforcement technology is difficult however, it's not impossible, take a look at the sources above.
