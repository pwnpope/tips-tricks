## Ignored parts of an email

The symbols: **+, -** and **{}** in rare occasions can be used for tagging and ignored by most e-mail servers
-   E.g. john.doe+intigriti@example.com → john.doe@example.com
    

**Comments between parentheses ()** at the beginning or the end will also be ignored
-   E.g. john.doe(intigriti)@example.com → john.doe@example.com


## Whitelist bypass

-   inti(;inti@inti.io;)@whitelisted.com
-   inti@inti.io(@whitelisted.com)
-   inti+(@whitelisted.com;)@inti.io

## IPs
##### You can also use IPs as domain named between square brackets:

-   john.doe@[127.0.0.1]
-   john.doe@[IPv6:2001:db8::1]

## XSS
- Some services like **github** or **salesforce allows** you to create an **email address with XSS payloads on it**. If you can **use this providers to login on other services** and this services **aren't sanitising** correctly the email, you could cause **XSS**.

## Account Takeover
- If a **SSO service** allows you to **create an account without verifying the given email address** (like **salesforce**) and then you can use that account to **login in a different service** that **trusts** salesforce, you could access any account.
- _Note that salesforce indicates if the given email was or not verified but so the application should take into account this info._
